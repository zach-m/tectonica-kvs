/**
 * Simple, yet powerful, framework (and approach) for handling a key-value store. It allows for multiple concurrent readers but a single
 * concurrent writer on each entry. It also provides a read-before-update mechanism which makes life simpler and keeps data consistent.
 * Indexing is also supported as part of the framework. The interface is intuitive and straightforward. This class itself is abstract and
 * subclasses are included for several backend persistence engines, including in-memory (which is great for development).
 * <p>
 * The usage of this framework would probably yield the most benefit when used to prototype a data model, where changes are frequent and not
 * backwards-compatible. However, in more than a few scenarios, this framework can be used in production. The heavy-lifting is done by the
 * backend database and cache either way.
